# Hangman

This is my coding challenge submission for day #7 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This application employs a list of words that are used in a simple hangman style game, for the user to guess letter by letter. On incorrect guesses, the application draws a part of hangman
